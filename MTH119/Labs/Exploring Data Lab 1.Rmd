```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)   # Load additional packages here

# Study Location
**Response Variable:** Study Location

**Explanatory Variable:** Personality

```{r}
#gf_bar(~StudyLocation|Personality,data=na.omit(Spring2023Dataset))
gf_barh(~StudyLocation|Personality,data=na.omit(Spring2023Dataset))

```

According to the graphs, the preferred study location seems to be a **Quiet Place** for introverts and extroverts alike.


```{r}
tally(~StudyLocation|Personality, data=na.omit(Spring2023Dataset), format="prop")
```

I Predicted that extroverted people would prefer a public space and introverted people would prefer quieter spaces. In reality, ~75% of extroverts prefer studying in a quiet place.

# Generosity
**Response Variable:** Generous

**Explanatory Variable:** Money Spent on yourself

```{r}
gf_boxplot(SpendOnYou~Generous, fill="darkgreen", data=na.omit(Spring2023Dataset))
```

The middle 50% of the less generous seem to spend more on themselves than the more generous.


```{r}
favstats(SpendOnYou~Generous, data=na.omit(Spring2023Dataset))
```

The numerical summaries show that the majority of people in Dr. Davidson's Statistic classes think that they are generous people.
