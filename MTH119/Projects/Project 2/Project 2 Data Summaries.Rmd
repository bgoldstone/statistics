# Topic: Factors that effect food choice.

**Interest**: We thought that food was a great universal topic to ask people. Everybody needs to eat to survive, so this is a great topic in order to limit bias and also who doesn't like food?

**Questions Asked**:

1. Which of the following factors most influence your food choices?  (Please select all that apply)

2. How much does cost factor into your food choices?

3. How often do you eat out at restaurants or order takeout?

4. How often do you consider the nutritional value of the foods you eat?

5. When making food choices, how important is it to you to consider the environmental impact of the food you consume?

**Survey Sent**: Posted to Facebook (older relatives), Instagram (General Friends), Women's Soccer Team, Direct Muhlenberg friend group, Muhlenberg Stem students


**Sample Size**: 50


## Hypothesis
People who order food because of price will likely eat out less than those who do not care about price.

## Data Collection

```{r}
library(readr)
DataCollectionSurvey <- read_csv("~/Projects/Project 2/DataCollectionSurvey.csv", 
    col_types = cols(FoodChoiceInfluencers = col_character(), 
        FrequencyOfRestaurantsOrTakeout = col_character(), 
        NutritionalValueConsideration = col_character(), 
        EnvironmentalImpactConsideration = col_character(), 
        CostConsideration = col_integer()))
head(DataCollectionSurvey)
gf_barh( ~ FoodChoiceInfluencers | FrequencyOfRestaurantsOrTakeout,data = na.omit(DataCollectionSurvey))

tally(~ FoodChoiceInfluencers | FrequencyOfRestaurantsOrTakeout,data =na.omit( DataCollectionSurvey))

nrow(DataCollectionSurvey)

```
## Graph Analysis & Statistic
People who eat in restaurants or take out from restaurants more frequently typically have more consistent food influences.

Of all of the people who eat out and care about price, **37.84%** eat out a few time a month because of price.


## Reflection

I think this experiment went fairly well for the most part. If I were to try and do this experiment again, I would probably ask people to select their most influential trait in deciding to go out to a restaurant or take out food instead of asking them to check as many as they want.
