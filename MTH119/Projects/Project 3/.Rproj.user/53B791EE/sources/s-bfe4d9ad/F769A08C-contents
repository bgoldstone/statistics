# Collection Method and Description
Using a ball and a bucket both of us did 20 trials with different hands and angles based on a random number from a random number generator to see if there is evidence that one way of throwing a ball is dominant. Each hand/angle combination was assigned a number from 1-4.

1. Left Over
2. Right Over
3. Left Under
4. Right Under

# Variables

Response: Make or Miss
Explanatory: Overhand/Underhand and Right Hand/Left Hand

```{r}
library(readr)
DataCollectionProject3 <- read_csv("~/Projects/Project 3/DataCollectionProject3.csv")
head(DataCollectionProject3)
```

# Hypotheses

H0: pi_left = pi_right

Ha: pi_left < pi_right


# Graphs

```{r}

gf_bar(~OverUnder|LeftRight, fill=~MakeMiss, data=DataCollectionProject3, position=position_dodge( ))%>%
gf_refine(scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkcyan","red")))

```

When throwing a ball into a basket, the right hand seems to make it into the basket more than the left hand.


# Proportion Test

```{r}
tally(MakeMiss~LeftRight, data=DataCollectionProject3)
prop.test(c(6,8),c(17,23),alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.9)

```
# Conclusion
Given a 90% confidence interval, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, due to 0 being included in the interval. With 0 being in the interval, it shows the null hypothesis to be a possibility.


We can conclude that there is a no significant difference between what hand you throw a ball with to make a shot.
